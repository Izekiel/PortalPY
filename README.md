# PortalPy
My project is PortalPy and is basically an attempt to remake the Valve Corporation’s game of Portal 
with a third person view rather than the first person view as in the game. Currently, my project is the game 
of Portal with working portals and level designs that allow for basic game play. To run this game, all the user 
has to have is the basic technologies to run python code, and then open the PortalPy.py file in the folder and 
build it. All necessary files are in the folder and it should work as it was built to do so. 
